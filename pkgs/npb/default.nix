    The NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB) are a small set of programs designed to
    help evaluate the performance of parallel supercomputers. The benchmarks
    are derived from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications and
    consist of five kernels and three pseudo-applications in the original
    "pencil-and-paper" specification (NPB 1). The benchmark suite has been
    extended to include new benchmarks for unstructured adaptive mesh,
    parallel I/O, multi-zone applications, and computational grids.  Problem
    sizes in NPB are predefined and indicated as different classes. Reference
    implementations of NPB are available in commonly-used programming models
    like MPI and OpenMP (NPB 2 and NPB 3)
